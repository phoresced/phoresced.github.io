          <h2>Identity & Values</h2>
            <h3>Using the evidence gathered, describe your core personal values.</h3>
          
            <br>Explain a situation where you have had an ethical decision to make. <br>Discuss how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you made, and the consequences of your action.
            <br>Describe how your culture has influenced your values and identity. 
          
          <p>"Joy by name and joy by nature", I am guided by the virtue of joy and the values courage, curiosity and compassion. I consider these three values to be the foundation for creativity and adaptability.</p>
          <p>In my early 20s I worked in various Wellington cafes. Time after time I saw the profit line drive the decisions the business owner made, to the point where the purpose of a cafe became entirely about commodity exchange. But as I interacted with the clientele, I realized there was more to cafes than caffiene and kai. Sometimes it was the human interaction, the warmth and community. Sometimes it was the culture, the 'vibe' of the place, or the ceremony of meeting someone for a shared experience. And underlying this was our connection to the plants we were ingesting, and the land which they grew on. I had to decide whether to keep serving the business model (landlords of retail premises gotta get paid!) at the expense of the wellbeing of the people, community, and the land. </p>
        <p>Holding compassion as a value influenced me to take a courageous leap, backed by my curiosity of what could be done differently, even in this economic climate.</p>
        <p>So I opened a gift economy teahouse, at the age of 23. It was a space for community, made by the community, and all those people who had asked these questions before me gave me a place to start. The challenge was harder than I could imagine, so the space served as a prototype trading the opportunity to experiment and create with certainty or longevity. However, it introduced me to some incredible concepts like permaculture and social enterprise, and taught me a lot about what I needed to learn if I were to keep on down this path.</p>
    <br>
    <p>The culture I grew up in was suburban, moderate, Christian, mixed race, working class. I never quite fit in. As early as I was able, sometimes facilitated by youth groups at church, I was going along to gigs. Music subculture became my culture. </p>
    <p>In some sense, struggling to break free of that weird suburban "normal" gave me an imperative to try new things, even if they didn't really fit me. The inner discomfort that I felt pushed me to take risks and ask questions, to get myself into territory where I could learn more from people outside my own demographic. I took inspiration from others who were sensitive to metaphysics and the innate aliveness of the natural world, but never associated myself as "a hippie". I resisted this term, which shaped my identity as a 'misfit among misfits' and as I've matured I've found that I can get along with anyone because I don't try to fit into any particular group, therefore the 'culture wars' slide off me like water off a duck's back.
    </p>
    <p>I've become diplomatic and able to see many perspectives. If I close off too easily (ie lose curiosity) then I get stuck. If I get comfortable then I stop growing, so I need to keep taking risks, I need courage. And while I have felt like an outlier most of my life, I derive a sense of security by recognizing my inherent connection to all beings, and practicing compassion, sharing joy and pain. This is so much stronger than the things which make us different from each other. 
    </p>
    <p>Since the answers were not laid out for me in the culture I was raised in, I had to take initiative, yet I finally learned that not everything needs to be made new (in fact, there is a Bible teaching about this in the old testament, Ecclesiastes. 'Nothing is new under the sun').
    </p>
    <p>I derived inspiration from learning about my ancestors and te ao maori, te marama o te tangata whenua o Aotearoa. From reconnecting with the land and her rhythms, relying more on these processes than the products of consumer culture, I learned what my values and priorities are and how these can shape my role in this time of shifting paradigms and ecological imbalance.
    </p>
        <h3>Using the evidence gathered, describe your strengths and limitations.</h3>
        Evaluate your strengths and limitations in terms of your learning and career development
        <br>Identify which of your strengths might help you in your learning journey and how they intersect with learning obstacles.

    <p>I have innate strengths in my technical capacity, I have the ability to perceive subtle details while also holding the whole picture, the systems. This reflects in my capacity for linguistics, which will be very helpful in programming. The limitation with this is my tendency to get overwhelmed by the size of the whole, I have trouble defining the range of scope because <em>it all matters</em> and I could be effective anywhere, so where am I most needed?
    </p>
    <p>
    Naturally I have been called into systemic work and am excited to learn more about full stack web systems even just to make better sense of the design potentials when communities want to interact with knowledge or the environment. The details which I choose to go forward and learning may be about information architecture, and translating information from the environment so it can be useful for stakeholder communities. I would like to use my social strengths in future work that I do (apparently I'm a peacock, although I don't feel like an archetypal extrovert!), and this draws on my experience working in hospitality.
    </p><br>
    <p>
    My emotional sensitivity and intuitive qualities can also overwhelm me and I have struggled with 'productivity' which sometimes seems at odds with my environmental pro-activism. I am concerned with perpetuating the consumer-growth-destructive cycle, doing for doing's sake. 
    </p>It's interesting that the last job I was recruited into was strongly based on my compassionate critique and my ability to make space for emotions and to intuit what the group might need or where the energy was shifting. I'm learning to trust this intelligence and not just assume that it's wrong simply because it's at odds with heaps of the narratives in workplace cultures. <p>It's also a dealbreaker for me if a workplace is not ready for this heart-led, process-before-product approach, or my ecosocial critiques. I don't make myself fit in, I work where my gifts are wanted, and fortunately they are speaking for themselves (it also helps me limit what I take on!)
    </p><br>
    <p>
    I might simplify the rest of this exercise by defining my strengths in clear terms: <strong>complex thinking across scales, fluidity, intuition and emotional sensitivity.</strong>
    </p>
    <p>In my learning journey, I am aided by the complex thinking across scales as I can quickly grasp abstract concepts and how they apply practically. I have been defined as pragmatic, and find kinesthetic learning suits me well, so being able to put what I'm learning into practice right away is perfect. I tend to seek out environments where this is the case, where learning is accompanied by doing, whether I'm paying or being paid for the privilege.
    </p>
    <p>My intuition and emotional sensitivity has helped me to make sense of the course instructions when they are more on the vague side (it's not common, but it happens!) and when I am able to help others interpret this, it reinforces my own learning.
      And because I am fluid, I can rise to the situation and the challenge.</p>
    <p>I can make obstacles for myself when I appear to know something and use my gift of charisma to, unfortunately, paint an image that I have understood when actually below the surface I haven't completely grasped the idea. So I have to hold myself accountable and have developed rigour and integrity as complementary values.
      My compassion and desire to connect with others can also get me paying more attention to the informal, fun, social side of something than the task at hand. I got told off a lot during school for talking in class. So far during the course I have found ways to engage without creating distractions, I have kept out of the voice channels while I focus on the mahi. But I'd like to stretch myself and see if I can participate fully without taking myself and/or others off course.</p>
    
    
      <h3>Share an example from your experience of where you were trying to work productively with others, but there was resistance or tension.</h3> 
      Discuss the strategies you used at that time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what other strategies you would try now and why.
    <p>Last year I was participating in a co-created festival, with a theme camp who I joined the year before. A quarter to one third of us had been at another co-created festival two weeks prior, and prototyped a feature which was a hit. We talked about doing it again at this next event, doing it better, and a handful seemed more engaged than the rest. I went op shopping for the right supplies and came to the second festival feeling inspired and committed. Unfortunately, the folks who were most engaged were busy with their own projects. The rest of the camp hadn't yet experienced the feature, and I also didn't know them very well (the person I was closest with was also the most enthusiastic, and the one who had the most projects too work on!)</p>
    <p>
    I didn't have all the skills to run the project on my own, and even when I got some quick lessons .(e.g. lashing), I couldn't build on my own. I needed help, and I was feeling abandoned and ignored.
  </p>
  <p>
    Perched one story up in the build environment, next to our camp kitchen, I created a habit of grabbing the attention of anyone who passed below and asking them to do something for me. This felt like a breakthrough because I had been struggling with leadership and delegation at work, and wanted to escape the 'tyranny of structurelessness' and 'firing circle' anti-patterns from 'horizontal'/'flat'/'equal' organisations. Without realising it, I was triggering and alienating the camp, and when no one spoke up about it I continued to interpret the behaviour of my campmates in my narrative of abandonment; ignoring turned into disrespect and rejection.
    </p>
    <p>
    My emotions were highly activated (I was menstruating, it was bloody hot, and I was picking up on signals of resentment without conscious recognition about what was going on). The grumpier I got, the more mutual resentment grew, but fortunately I got the help I needed from a couple of friends, once they had the time.
    The strategies I was using was: learn what I could to empower myself however I could work alone, delegate tasks to people who seemed to be standing around with nothing to do, and behave grumpily to show that I was feeling let down.
    </p>
    <p>
    Learning how to lash was great and when my friends did help, the skill came in handy. I could contribute significantly to my own project and not completely rely on others.
    The strategy to delegate was *not* appropriate in that environment. I made assumptions and operated in a non-consensual way. I would improve on this next time by taking a breath, sensing into other people's workflows, and choosing my moments to express my needs in general, so I could ask for help in a way that people could say no or could choose when and how they might be able to help me. Underlying this, I would be patient. Although I had a deadline in mind, it's hard to have any fun when that completely takes over.
    </p>
    <p>
    The last strategy of grumpiness was an example of emotional manipulation. It didn't make anything better and **did** make everything worse. I'll do my best to avoid it in the future.
    There were other strategies I could have tried. I could state my intention clearly ahead of the build day, and give people time to communicate whether they wanted to be involved or not. I could follow up 1:1 with people who didn't say anything but who I would like the help of. Without trying to manipulate them, I would find out what *their* dreams, plans, and priorities were. I could look at the whole picture to see whether my contribution fit well with everything else or if my energy might be better spent elsewhere. I wouldn't just go along with the vocal excitement of a few members (when the enthusiasm does <strong>not</strong> express commitment). In future I will definitely recognize the difference.
    </p>
    <p>
    I could also plan the project to be simpler, to start small with room to expand if the motivation was there. And if I felt any sense of abandonment, I would take time out to tune into this feeling and might recognize that there was unspoken or even unacknowledged mutual resentment forming... to catch this and attempt communication before it got worse, and respect if the other parties didn't want to take that opportunity. Even though I am comfortable initiating something, I can't expect others to go along with my invitation, nor does rejection need to be taken personally. But also, it might be personal, and that's okay. 
    </p>
    <p>
    I could create some quiet healing space for myself to reflect on whether my actions are in line with my values and whether I'm respecting other peoples values and needs. Come back to why we are here. Then I might realise, hey, we thought this feature was a strategy for fun but the fun is not happening here so how about we scrap it? It's okay to let go when that kinda feedback reveals itself. In fact, the first whakataukī that I wrote when brainstorming my values was "the how is as (if not more) important as the what"!
