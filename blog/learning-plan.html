          <h3>What skills (non-technical - human skills) would I like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</h3>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Getting into a nice groove with my workflow
              <li>Time estimation
              <li>Structuring the design process across multiple dynamic elements

          <h3>A commitment to how I will manage my workload in this programme.</h3>
          <p>
            <ul>
            <li><strong>Log Out Loud:</strong> Throughout the day, I tune in, creating habitual data points.
            The heading of my daily blog sets my intention, the html nests my process plan. I start my timer.
            <li>This log sets and checks my goals and what I learned. I‚Äôm going to keep up this habit as it‚Äôs been really helpful in the first couple weeks.
            <li>I can play with introducing comments in the code margins, and creating rules and classes that reference patterns. Leave research trails. üîç
            </ul>
          </p>
          <h3>A commitment as to how and where I will seek help in a timely way</h3>
          <p>
            Depending how I feel, I could:
            <ul>
              <li> Send a message to my facilitator
              <li>go sit in a co-working space if not already in one.
              <li>read discord, search keywords for specific problems
              <li>browse the memex for its ideas, sniff out trails
              <li>meditate on the problem;
              <li>Write an entry into my log-out-loud (incident and research book) /
                    journal
            </ul>
          </p>
          <h3>An explanation of how I will manage myself to work productively and
          safely with other learners, facilitators and industry/community
          representatives</h3>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>always consent culture</li>
              <li>doing what I say I will do! keep my word.</li>
              <li>making time and space to prepare and to unwind, to self care.</li>
              <li>being available for those who depend on me, respecting peoples time, and honouring our shared interest or risk.
              <li>I like this practice:</li>
              </ul>
          </p>
            <p>Gates of speech: before I say (or publish) something, ask myself:
                <ol>
                  <li> is this true?</li>
                  <li> is this necessary?</li>
                  <li> is this helpful?</li>
                  <li> is this kind?</li>
                </ol>
          </p>
          <h3>What I will do when things are building up and starting to get to me</h3>
          <p>
            <ul>
            <li>tune into my breath;</li>
            <li>take my dog for a walk;</li>
            <li>do some weeding in the garden;</li>
            <li>put on some awesome music and dance for 5 minutes!</li>
            </ul> 
          </p>
          <h3>A description of my strengths and limitations concerning learning</h3>
          <p>
            <ul>
            <li><strong>Strengths:</strong> literacy, street and book wits, determination, problem solving, critical thinking, when i was in year 11 maths i got in a lot of trouble for talking but still passed with Excellence on geometric reasoning. My talking is its own strength and character.</li>
            <li><strong>Weaknesses:</strong> numeracy, procrastination, sensitivity, going off topic. Real talk, I don‚Äôt love to be rushed through content, I like to savour it. The learning is beautiful, the rush of new neurons. So yeah talking too much and navel gazing.</li>
            </ul> 
                <aside>
                üìé I can work well <strong>alone and together,</strong> and can intuitively <strong>make sense of abstract concepts.</strong> Being curious, I need to counter-balance: by <strong>practicing my focus.</strong> 
                I set morning goals related to the project and the process, and reflect in the pm. 
                Aspirationally: I habitually keep an open <strong>log of events,</strong> woven in with my daily rhythm.   
                </aside>
          </p>   
          <h3>A description of what I expect from the facilitation team</h3>
          <p>      
            <ul>
              <li>Bringing my awareness to possible avenues that might get me unstuck, not telling me an answer. Helping me to question my logic and reveal my blind spots.</li>
              <li>Share conversations about insights, interests ; cultivate mutual trust + appreciation.</li>
              <li>Consent culture, asking before sharing private/sensitive information with others.</li>
              <li>Hold the space if conflict emerges in our group space, sense into tensions to guide appropriate and respectful behaviour and/or process.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>    

          <h3>Scheduling information</h3>
