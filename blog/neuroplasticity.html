        <h2>Cultivating my brain</h2>
        <p class="text"> 
          This week during dev academy, we are reflecting on neuroplasticity and having a growth mindset rather than a fixed mindset.
        </p>
        <p>Knowing that our brains <em>can be cultivated</em> is profoundly influential in any intentional learning, and is a beautiful way to approach life and our participation in it.</p>
        <p>I remember sitting on a train in the north of India at the start of 2018 and listening to <a href="https://www.teamhuman.fm/episodes/ep-63-daring-democracy/">a Team Human podcast with Francis Moore Lappe</a>. She said something in that interview which has stuck with me, and which I feel shines a light on the power of a growth mindset vs a fixed mindset.</p>
        <p>This author and ecological activist mentioned that our brains don't give up working on a problem until we believe there is no solution.</p>
        <p>Even though we are facing potentially disastrous, strenuous, VUCA (volatile, uncertain, complex and ambiguous) times on this planet, and 'solutions' might seem elusive or non-transferrable from situation to situation, we can choose to stay in a growth mindset about this.</p>
        <p>If you keep hope that solutions are possible, your brain subconsciously collects information and forms associations, laying the foundations for insight. Something could happen which triggers subconscious neural connections and suddenly you have an idea for preventing food shortage in your neighbourhood, for example.</p>
        <h3>Imagination</h3>
        <p>Researchers have demonstrated that we can strengthen the bonds between areas of our brain through practice; and not only through physical practice, but also by mental repetition.</p>
        <p>Well, what if we used this process to support learning web development?</p>
        <p>Finding where our mindset is fixed and where it is prepared for growth involves examining our core beliefs. <br>Let me ask you this: when you think about this industry and the kind of people and jobs in tech, who or what do you imagine? Can you see yourself as part of a team? Do you feel excited or a sense of dread?</p>
        <p>Depending on how we answer this, we might be creating attraction or avoidance for ourselves. Begin with the power of imagination to anticipate all the moments of flow, accomplishment and belonging that you could experience in your career. <br>Seek out role models who you can see yourself in, and you will begin to feel at home, creating the career opportunities that are going to support you to work with integrity and purpose.</p>
        <h3>Speaking of variance...</h3>
        <p>None of us is perfectly alike. The paths we are walking might traverse similar territory, but each journey is unique.</p>
        <p>To be informed by the science of neuroplasticity is to situate yourself and your skills as a temporary expression of what's possible. A fixed mindset says we have a 'skill<em>set</em>, while a growth mindset might warrant a new term, like <em>skillflex</em> (I learned this while studying with <a href="gaiauniversity.org/">Gaia University</a>  ).</p>
        <p>Where we have discussed our strengths and weaknesses in the former <a href="learning-plan.html">learning plan</a>, there is an opportunity to evaluate our relationship to our weaknesses.</p>
        <p>Do we say, "This is where I'm not going to do well, I don't expect to do well, and I've already given up on anything connected to this ability"? Or do we create a learning plan which says, "I am going to spend extra time strengthening these weak areas"?</p>
        <p>One of the best ways to strengthen our neural connections (and therefore our abilities) is through repetition. Frequency is more important than duration. Can you invest 5 minutes every day practicing a skill which you aren't confident in? <br>Remember, you don't need to physically do something to get results; maybe you try to solve a mental problem, or imagine yourself in a challenging situation and play around with ways you can respond. If we keep it fun, it's more likely we'll build a successful habit, because we are chemically associating that exercise with positive reinforcement.</p>
        <h3>Normal is relative</h3>
        <p>Culture and society are wonderful adaptations for outsourcing knowledge. Cultures have rituals, ceremonies and practices which have served to pass down information and behaviour suited to that culture's context. With every practice, the knowledge is reinforced; and with each person, new insights are possible, and adaptation is possible. There is balance between cohesive reality and dynamism.</p>
        <p>In a modern, globally connected world, these social strategies can be misapplied. We look at the people around us to determine how to behave. We are influenced by the opinions that people have about us.</p>
        <p>I have been reflecting on my learning patterns in light of the growth vs fixed mindset model, and realized that sometimes I sabotage my learning process by getting stuck in someone else's version of reality. They might say "Wow you're not good at this”, or I might create a story that they are thinking this even if it's never said aloud. And so I think, why bother continuing then? </p>
        <p> Or I might receive some approval for my work and think, well if I'm technically passing, then any more effort is wasted. Instead of practicing my skills or challenging myself, I do the minimum, because I'm already <em>good enough</em>.
          <p>So during this course, I want to become more aware of how seeking approval might influence how I measure my work; and not be discouraged by such comments, or internal monologue about my abilities, like "the facilitators must think I'm so dumb because I'm asking so many questions!" (I admit I'm guilty of this paranoia). <br>Instead, I want to set and stick to goals; and while I welcome constructive criticism, if a comment about my work makes me want to give up then I can remind myself, they're just expressing an opinion and I don't need to take this in. </p>
          <p>I'm not going to consider my abilities as 'talents', but as the results of practice. When someone says “you're good at ___” or “I like how you ___”, I can respond, “Thanks, I've been working on that” rather than take it as a comment on my inherent character.</p>
          <p> The wisdom in ancient cultures has survived through ritual and ceremony, practices which are kept alive and outsourced to the collective, so that it is normalized at an individual level. What habit practices are being normalized in web dev culture, or the subcultures related to it? Can we choose healthy habits and populate our communities with these? If so, we also need to appreciate variation. Everyone has their own best fit.</p>
          <p>What is the <em>new normal</em> that you're choosing to create?</p>
